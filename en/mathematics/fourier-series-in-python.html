			<h1>Fourier Series in Python</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			The <em>Fourier series</em> is a representation of a periodic function by an infinite sum (a series then)
			of functions $\sin$ and $\cos$ multiplied by appropriate coefficients.<br />
			In the case of real-valued functions of one real variable, let $f(t)$ be a $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ periodic of period $P$ integrable, limited and continuous at intervals in the interval $[0, P]$:
			such a function can be represented as <em>real-form Fourier series</em>:
            
    $$ f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^\infty [a_n \cos{\frac{2 \pi n t}{P}} + b_n \sin{\frac {2 \pi n t}{P}}] $$

            where the coefficients $a_n$ and $b_n$ are real and are defined as follows:
            
    $$ a_0 = \frac{2}{P} \int_{0}^{P} f(t) \,dt $$

            
    $$ a_n = \frac{2}{P} \int_{0}^{P} f(t) \cos{\frac{ 2 \pi n t}{P}}\,dt $$

            
    $$ b_n = \frac{2}{P} \int_{0}^{P} f(t) \sin{\frac{2 \pi n t}{P}}\,dt $$

			By applying Euler's formula, the function $f(t)$ can also be represented in the <em>complex</em> form:
            
    $$ f(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty c_n e^{\frac{2 i \pi n t}{P}}$$
 where the coefficients $c_n$ are complex and so defined:
            
    $$ c_n = \frac{1}{P} \int_{0}^{P} f(t) e^{\frac{-2 i \pi n t}{P}}\,dt $$

			In the case of complex-valued functions of a real variable, let $f(t)$ be a $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ periodic function of period $P$ that is integrable, limited and continuous at intervals in the interval $[0, P]$:
			the real form of the Fourier series cannot be used, but the complex form just shown can.<br />
			At points of discontinuity, the value of the Fourier series is equal to the mean of the left limit and the right limit.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Note:</b> In some texts, in presenting the Fourier series formula, it is implicitly assumed that the period is $2 \pi$, whereas in this post
			the more general form is given where the period can take any value and is denoted by $P$.<br />
			<b>Note:</b> In some texts the integrals in the Fourier series formula are calculated in the interval $[\frac{-P}{2}, \frac{P}{2}]$;
			by a Fourier series theorem, the integration interval can be freely shifted and
			the only important thing is that it is of equal length per period;
			for simplicity of implementation here we have chosen the interval $[0, P].$<br />
			<b>Note:</b> In some texts, the period is denoted by $2P$, so $P$ would become the semi-period and this would allow to eliminate a factor $2$ in the numerator in the formulas in the real form;
			however, in this post and in the related code, the period &egrave; denoted by $P$ and the factor $2$ in the numerator of the formulas remains.<br />
			<br />
			There is an alternative way to calculate the complex coefficients of the Fourier series, and that is to use the <em>Fourier transform</em>.<br />
			The Fourier transform is used extensively in physics and engineering because it allows a time-dependent function to be written
			as a linear combination of a basis of exponential functions. This post does not cover the theory or applications
			of the Fourier transform, but merely uses it to calculate the complex $c_n$ coefficients of the Fourier series
			since there is a relationship between the coefficients of the series and the Fourier transform.</br >
			<br />
			Let $x(t)$ be an aperiodic function; the definition of the Fourier transform of the function $x(t)$ is as follows:
			
    $$ X(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} x(t) e^{-i \omega t} \,dt $$

			For the purpose of calculating the coefficients of the Fourier series to represent a periodic function $f(t)$
			it is not possible to apply the Fourier transform to this function, because it is periodic;
			but we must consider only one period of this function (for example the interval $[0, P]$)
			and then define an extended function $f_P(t)$ which takes the value of the function $f(t)$ for every $t in [0, P]$
			and is worth $0$ for values of $t$ outside this interval. Formally:
			
    $$ 
    f_P(t) =
    \begin{cases}f(t) & t \in [0, P] \\ 0 & t \notin [0, P] \end{cases} 
    $$

			Let $F_P$ be the Fourier transform applied to $f_P(t)$: since the latter is worth $0$ outside the interval $[0, P]$, the following steps apply:
			
    $$
        F_P(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f_P(t) e^{-i \omega t} \,dt
        = \int_{0}^{P} f_P(t) e^{-i \omega t} \,dt
        = \int_{0}^{P} f(t) e^{-i \omega t} \,dt
    $$

			Recalling that $c_n$ holds:
			
    $$ c_n = \frac{1}{P} \int_{0}^{P} f(t) e^{\frac{-2 i \pi n t}{P}}\,dt $$

			setting:
			$$ \omega_0 = \frac{2 \pi}{P} $$
			we derive the relationship between any $c_n$ coefficient and the Fuorier transform by following the steps below:
			
    $$
        F_P(n \omega_0) 
        = \int_{0}^{P} f(t) e^{-i n \omega_0 t} \,dt
        = \int_{0}^{P} f(t) e^{\frac{-2 i \pi n t}{P}} \,dt
        = c_n P
    $$

			and then:
			
    $$ c_n = \frac{1}{P} F_P(n \omega_0) $$
 
			<br />
			There is also an n-dimensional formulation of the Fourier series, but its real form is uncompact and of little use for practical purposes;
			instead the complex form of the multidimensional Fourier series is compact and is obtained by generalization of the one-dimensional complex form.
			In the two-dimensional case (2 independent variables) formula is as follows:
			
    $$ f(x, y) = \sum_{n_1, n_2=-\infty}^\infty c_{n_1, n_2} e^{\frac{2 i \pi n_1 x}{P_x}} e^{\frac{2 i \pi n_2 y}{P_y}} $$

			where
			
    $$ c_{n_1, n_2} = \frac{1}{P_x} \frac{1}{P_y} \int_{0}^{P_y} \int_{0}^{P_x} f(x, y) e^{\frac{-2 i \pi n_1 x}{P_x}} e^{\frac{-2 i \pi n_2 y}{P_y}}\,dx\,dy $$

			In the multidimensional case with $d$ dimensions it is good to use vector notation; let $\mathbf{x}$ be the vector of independent variables
			and the formula for the multidimensional Fourier series in the complex form is as follows:
			
    $$ f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{\mathbf{n} \in \mathbb{Z}^d} c_{\mathbf{n}} e^{\frac{2 i \pi n_1 x_1}{P_1}} ... e^{\frac{2 i \pi n_d x_d}{P_d}} $$

			where
			
    $$ c_{\mathbf{n}} = \frac{1}{P_1} ... \frac{1}{P_d} \int_{[0, P_1] \times ... \times [0, P_d]} f(\mathbf{x}) e^{\frac{-2 i \pi n_1 x_1}{P_1}} ... e^{\frac{-2 i \pi n_d x_d}{P_d}}\,d\mathbf{x} $$

		<h2>Demo index</h2>
		<p>
			The <a href="#hdemo1">demo #1</a> shows the approximation of a periodic function via Fourier series by applying the definition in the real form.
			Of course, summation cannot go all the way to infinity, so the summation cycles will have to be limited to a value of $N$
			not very large, for obvious performance reasons, but enough to have an acceptable approximation.
			As far as integral calculations are concerned, the <em>SciPy</em> library is used and in particular the <code>quad</code> function;
			please refer to the post <a href="../../en/mathematics/integral-calculus-in-python.html">Integral Calculus in Python</a> on this site for details about integration in Python.<br />
			<br />
			The <a href="#hdemo2">demo #2</a> shows the approximation of the same periodic function but through Fourier series by applying the definition in the complex form.
			As for the calculations of complex integrals we use the <em>SciPy</em> library integrating separately the real and imaginary part.
			<br />
			The <a href="#hdemo3">demo #3</a> shows the approximation of a complex-valued periodic function by Fourier series applying of course the definition in the complex form.<br />
			<br />
			From an application point of view, you might wonder what is the point of approximating a function if you already know the function itself.
			The answer is simple (and the one provided here is not the only possible answer): in the real world, the periodic function may not be known
			but may be available in the form of discrete data (e.g., acquired via sensors or field measurements); in this case the approximation by Fourier series
			becomes very useful obviously by performing calculations of integrals using discrete integration techniques.<br />
			The <a href="#hdemo4">demo #4</a> and the <a href="#hdemo5">demo #5</a> show how to obtain the Fourier series starting from a discrete set of values (and therefore no longer from an analytical function given a priori);
			precisely the demo #4 operates on a real-valued dataset while the demo #4 on a complex-valued dataset.<br />
			<br />
			The <a href="#hdemo6">demo #6</a>, the <a href="#hdemo7">demo #7</a> and the <a href="#hdemo8">demo #8</a> show how to compute the complex coefficients $c_n$ using the Fourier transform;
			in particular demo #6 applies to the continuous case and requires the use of integrals,
			while the other two apply to the discrete case and do not require integral calculus;
			in particular demo #8 uses the function of the SciPy library to compute the <em>fast Fourier transform</em> which is an optimized algorithm
			to compute the discrete Fourier transform efficiently.<br />
			<br />
			The <a href="#hdemo9">demo #9</a> and the <a href="#hdemo10">demo #10</a> are like demo #6 and demo #8
			but apply to a complex-valued function and a complex-valued discrete dataset, respectively.<br />
			<br />
			The <a href="#hdemo11">demo #11</a> and the <a href="#hdemo12">demo #12</a> concern the two-dimensional Fourier series and apply respectively
			to the case of a real-valued function of two real variables and to a two-dimensional discrete dataset (in the sense of a set of points lying on a surface in three-dimensional space), respectively.<br />
			<br />
			The reader is invited to generalize these cases, for example by extending demo #11 and demo #12
			to the case of functions (or datasets) with complex values and/or to the n-dimensional case (where the vector notation is certainly more suitable than having a variable for each dimension).

		<h2>Calculation of the Fourier series by applying the definition</h2>

        <h3 id="hdemo1">Demo #1: Calculation of the Fourier series in the real form of a real-valued function of one real variable</h3>
		<p>
			Let the function $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be given:
			
    $$ f(t) = ((t \mod P) - (P / 2)) ^ 3, P=3$$

			which is periodic of period equal to $3$, finite and step continuous.<br />
			<br />
			Below is the example of Python code that applies the definition of the Fourier series in real form to approximate that function:
            <pre><code class="python" id="demo1_code"></code></pre>
            Here is the link to the code on GitHub: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ettoremessina/function-fitting/blob/master/demos/python/fourier-series/fourier-series-func-rtor-using-definition-with-real-coeffs.py">fourier-series-func-rtor-using-definition-with-real-coeffs.py</a>.<br />
			<br />
			The following image shows graphically how the function approximated with the Fourier series improves in approximation
			as the value of $N$ (the maximum index of the summation) increases.
			Observe that already for $N$ equal to $8$ an acceptable approximation is obtained.
